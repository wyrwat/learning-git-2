	<h1>Tool</h1>
	<h2>Parabola</h2>
	<p>We barely remember
	Who or what came before this precious moment
	We are choosing to be here
	Right now
	Hold on, stay inside

	This holy reality
	This holy experience
	Choosing to be here in
	This body
	This body holding me
	Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
	This body
	This body holding me
	Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion

	Alive, I

	In this holy reality
	In this holy experience
	Choosing to be here in

	This body
	This body holding me
	Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
	This body
	This body holding me
	Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion</p>
