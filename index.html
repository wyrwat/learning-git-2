	<h2>Parabola</h2>
	<p>We barely remember
	Who or what came before this precious moment
	We are choosing to be here
	Right now
	Hold on, stay inside</p>
	<p>This holy reality
	This holy experience
	Choosing to be here in
	This body
	This body holding me
	Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
	This body
	This body holding me
	Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion</p>
	<p>Alive, I
	In this holy reality
	In this holy experience
	Choosing to be here in
	This body
	This body holding me
	Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
	This body
	This body holding me
	Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion</p>
	<p>Twirling round with this familiar parable
	Spinning, weaving round each new experience
	Recognize this as a holy gift and
	Celebrate this chance to
	Be alive and breathing
	A chance to be
	Alive and breathing</p>
	<p>This body holding me
	Reminds me of my own mortality
	Embrace this moment
	Remember
	We are eternal
	All this pain is an illusion </p>
